# Existing NLP curricula
- Fast.ai has a Python-based course. The [blog post](https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/) has a full overview. Here, we focus on the code and data in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fastai/course-nlp)
- Rochelle Terman has a recent week-long workshop in R in this [GitHub repo]().

For the purposes of the current exploration, I'll keep all data in an attached dataset - even if they aren't that big.
