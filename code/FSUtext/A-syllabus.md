# Introduction to Computational Text Analysis

### Overview

This course introduces students to modern quantitative text analysis techniques. The goal is to provide an orientation for those wishing to go further with text analysis in their own research. We will use the open source programming language `R`. Demonstration corpora are provided. 

### Prerequisites

This course is geared towards social scientists who work with unstructured text data, including (but not limited to) news and media, open-ended surveys, social media posts, etc.

Students must have basic computer skills, must be familiar with their computer’s file system, and must be comfortable entering commands in a command line environment. 

The workshop will also assume basic knowledge of the R programming language.Students are strongly encourged to complete [this brief tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r) to learn the basic syntax of the R programming language

Please read the following to get a sense of what we'll be doing:

### Software Required

See the [tech requirements page](B-Tech-Requirements.md) for detailed information on the software we'll be using. Please download and install **before coming to the workshop.** If you have difficulties installing, please contact Rochelle at rterman@uchicago.edu
