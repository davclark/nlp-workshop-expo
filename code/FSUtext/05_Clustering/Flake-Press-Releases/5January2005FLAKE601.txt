Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today
highlighted another pork project contained in the massive omnibus spending bill
that Congress passed late last year.

This week's egregious earmark: $2,300,000 - Animal Waste Management Research
Laboratory in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

"I grew up on a ranch in Arizona where I 'managed' more than my fair share of
animal waste with a shovel, and earmarks like these remind me of those days,"
said Flake.
