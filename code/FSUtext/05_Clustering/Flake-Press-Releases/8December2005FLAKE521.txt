Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, today said
the Committee's passage of a border security bill is only the first step in
addressing our country's immigration crisis.

He stressed that a temporary worker program must be included as part of the
final bill to effectively address the problem.

"I am glad that Congress has, at long last, decided to address our immigration
crisis," said Flake.

"It's important to recognize that this is simply the first step. Chairman
Sensenbrenner believes, as I do, that a comprehensive temporary worker is
necessary if we really want to secure the border. I intend to work with him to
achieve that end."

Congressman Flake, along with Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Luis Gutierrez and
Senators John McCain and Edward Kennedy, has introduced legislation that will
create a temporary worker program. The Secure America and Orderly Immigration
Act (H.R. 2330) will enhance national security, meet U.S. labor demands, and
prevent deaths at the border by creating a comprehensive temporary worker
program.
