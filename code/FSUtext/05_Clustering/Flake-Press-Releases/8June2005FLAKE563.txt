Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today
highlighted another pork project contained in the massive omnibus spending bill
that Congress passed for fiscal year 2005.

This week's egregious earmark: $50,000 for workforce development at Fashion
Business, Inc. in Los Angeles, California.

"Earmarks like this make me wonder when it went out of fashion for we
Republicans to be fiscally responsible," said Flake.
