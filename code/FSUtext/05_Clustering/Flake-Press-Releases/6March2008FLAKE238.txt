Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today encouraged House Democrats to adopt a moratorium on earmarks.

"Actions speak louder than words and, unfortunately, both parties have only
offered the latter on earmark reform," said Flake.

"The first party to impose a moratorium will rightfully be able to claim
credibility on this issue. I'm still hopeful that Republicans will demonstrate
leadership on earmark reform by declaring our own moratorium, but if the
Democrats beat us to it, more power to them."

Democrats have reportedly been considering an earmark moratorium as a way to
free up money for an economic stimulus bill.

"The fact that Democrats are considering an earmark moratorium to free up
funding for other priorities disproves the tired myth that cutting earmarks
doesn't save money."
