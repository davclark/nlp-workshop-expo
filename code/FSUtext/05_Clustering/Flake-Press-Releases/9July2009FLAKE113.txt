WASHINGTON, July 8 -- Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following
press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today praised the recommendations of the Council on Foreign Affairs' Independent
Task Force on U.S. Immigration Policy. The bipartisan task force recommended a
comprehensive overhaul of U.S. immigration policy in order to enhance national
security, attract skilled workers, improve the U.S.'s international image, and
uphold American values. Among the recommended reforms, the task force suggested
that foreign students studying in the U.S. be allowed to stay and work in the
country after earning advanced degrees. "Unless we adjust our immigration policy
to allowed foreign-born, U.S.-educated students to remain and work in the
country after they've graduated, we're going to continue to see our technology
industry move overseas," said Flake. Congressman Flake has introduced the STAPLE
Act (H.R. 1791), which would exempt from visa quotas foreign students who have
earned a Ph.D. degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics from a
U.S. university and have a job offer in the U.S.For more information please
