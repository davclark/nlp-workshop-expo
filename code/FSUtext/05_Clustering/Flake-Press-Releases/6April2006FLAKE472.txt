Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following statement:

Arizona Republican Reps. Jeff Flake and Jim Kolbe and Democratic Rep. Luis
Gutierrez of Illinois today issued the following statements regarding the Senate
compromise on immigration reform.

"This is a true compromise in the sense that all sides have made concessions,
but this is certainly a very workable proposal that will bring us a step closer
to a comprehensive temporary worker program," said Flake.

"I am pleased to see the Senate found a solution to the illegal immigration
problems. I support the reported compromise as a means to moving the debate
forward and reaching an agreement with the House. My hope is that the House will
be able to cast a vote on a complete immigration bill, which can pass," said
Rep. Kolbe.

"This compromise is a victory for those who oppose the punitive enforcement-only
approach passed in the House. While the devil is in the details, we must work to
ensure that any bill that passes Congress has a path to permanency for hard
working, tax- paying immigrants who are making positive contributions to our
communities," said Rep. Gutierrez.
