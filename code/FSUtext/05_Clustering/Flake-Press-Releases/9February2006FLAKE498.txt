Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today
praised Sen. McCain and a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators for introducing a
comprehensive earmark reform bill.

Congressman Flake has introduced a bipartisan earmark reform bill (H.R. 1642),
which currently has 63 cosponsors. H.R. 1642 requires that earmarks be included
in the actual text of spending bills, rather than the committee or conference
reports that accompany bills. This would give Members of Congress an opportunity
to eliminate projects that are wasteful or unnecessary when bills come to the
House floor.

Senator McCain's earmark reform proposal includes language comparable to H.R.
1642.

"Senator McCain's credentials on earmark reform are second to none," said Flake.

"He's long been a lonely voice for earmark reform, and it's encouraging to see
that he's finally getting some company."
