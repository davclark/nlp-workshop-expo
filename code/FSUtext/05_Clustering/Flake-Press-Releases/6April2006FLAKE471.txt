Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today voted
against a bill encouraging Americans to support the goals and ideals of
Financial Literacy Month, which include balancing a checkbook and sticking to a
budget.

"Congress is in no position to teach Americans how to manage their finances,"
said Flake.

"Rather than voting for this bill, I would support the goals and ideals of
Financial Literacy Month by encouraging all Americans not to use Congress as a
financial role model."
