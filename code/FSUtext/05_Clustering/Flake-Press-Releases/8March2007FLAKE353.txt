Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today sent
President Bush a letter urging him to continue to instruct federal departments
and agencies to disregard earmarks not included in the actual text of
appropriations bills.

Office of Management and Budget Director Rob Portman issued a memo last month
instructing federal departments and agencies to refrain from using funds
provided in the spending bill for fiscal year 2007 on earmarks that have not
been included in statutory language.

As Congress begins work on spending bills for fiscal year 2008, Congressman
Flake urged President Bush to continue the policy, which would subject earmarks
to increased levels of scrutiny and accountability.

"The deadline for earmark requests is next week, and Congress is ready to make
up for lost time," said Flake. "By announcing that he won't fund earmarks that
aren't included in the legislative text of bills, President Bush can keep us
from falling back into old habits."

Congressman Flake has introduced legislation (H.R. 631) that would require that
earmarks be included in the legislative text of bills.
