Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today
expressed disappointment that the immigration reform bill has been pulled from
the Senate calendar.

"Inaction on immigration reform is a victory for no one," said Flake, "so I hope
that this latest setback in the Senate is just a delay and not a death knell."

Congressman Flake, along with Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, has
introduced the STRIVE Act, which would increase border security, strengthen
interior enforcement, create a temporary worker program, and deny amnesty to
illegal immigrants.
