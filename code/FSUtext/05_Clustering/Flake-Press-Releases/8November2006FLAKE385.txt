Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, faulted the results of
the midterm elections on congressional Republicans' drift from the principles of
limited government and fiscal responsibility.

"We Republicans have lost our brand name on fiscal issues. Voters simply no
longer believe that Republicans are best suited to handle the federal purse
strings," said Flake.

"It's unfortunate that it took a defeat like this for us to realize that we
badly needed a course correction, but that's where we find ourselves this
morning. We must now begin the work of earning back the trust of the voters."
