Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today
called on Congress to make more substantial spending cuts than those offered in
President Bush's budget for fiscal year 2007.

"Both President Roosevelt and Truman made substantial cuts in social programs
during wartime," said Flake. "And, as a conservative Republican, it pains me to
say this, but we ought to follow their example."

"The restraint on spending in this budget simply isn't sufficient."

"In order to protect our rebounding economy and our ability to fully fund the
war, we need to consider an across-the-board cut in non-defense discretionary
spending and we need to begin tackling entitlement reform."
