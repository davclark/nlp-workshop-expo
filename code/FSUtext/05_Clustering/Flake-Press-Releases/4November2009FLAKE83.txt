REP. FLAKE JOINS PUSH TO ENROLL MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN THE PUBLIC OPTION

LENGTH: 184  words


WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 -- Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following
press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today joined with other Republicans to require an amendment to the healthcare
bill that would automatically enroll all Members of Congress in the public
option.

Democrats have not said whether or not they will allow such an amendment to be
offered during debate on the healthcare bill.

"The word 'shall' appears over 3000 times in the healthcare bill," said Flake.
"Yet, the provision concerning Members of Congress enrolling in the public
option says 'may,' not 'shall.'"

"That's not merely an oversight; Democrats don't want to have to enroll in the
public option. That says a lot about the quality of healthcare Americans can
expect if this bill passes."

Congressman John Fleming of Louisiana, the lead sponsor of the amendment, will
hold a press conference tomorrow at 9:00am EST at the House Triangle with other
supporters of the amendment.For more information please contact: Sarabjit
