Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today lauded
passage of legislation that will enhance national security by creating national
standards for state-issued identification cards.

"State-issued driver's licenses have become de facto national ID cards, and to
the extent that they're used as a form of federal identification, the federal
government has a responsibility to ensure that these cards are secure," said
Flake.

"These reforms are practical changes that many states already have in place.
However, even a few states with lax standards can jeopardize the security of the
entire country."

Congressman Flake offered legislation last Congress that would have required
that state-issued identification cards meet certain standards in order to be
recognized by the federal government. He also introduced legislation that would
have required that states issue identification cards that expire on or before
the expiration date of a foreign national's visa.
