Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today
highlighted another pork project contained in the massive omnibus spending bill
that Congress passed for fiscal year 2005.

This week's egregious earmark: $10,000,000 for the Alaska Fisheries Marketing
Board. The Board used the earmark to issue a $500,000 grant to Alaska Airlines
to custom paint the image of a huge king salmon onto one of their 737 passenger
planes.

"I would have thought I'd see pigs fly before Congress would pay $500,000 for a
flying fish," said Flake.

The Anchorage Daily News reported the $500,000 grant to Alaska Airlines on
Sunday (http://www.adn.com/front/story/7038924p-6942571c.html).
