Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today
opposed a campaign regulatory bill targeting so-called 527 groups.

"An overwhelming majority of House Republicans opposed McCain-Feingold because
it restricted political speech and expression," said Flake, "and here we are a
few years later, essentially trying to expand McCain-Feingold."

"It may be politically expedient in the short term to restrict what our
political opponents can say or how much money they can raise, but Republicans
run a far greater risk if we get out of the practice of expanding freedom and
start limiting it."
