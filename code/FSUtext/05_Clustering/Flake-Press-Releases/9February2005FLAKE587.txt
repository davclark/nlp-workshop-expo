Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, a member of the House International Relations
Committee, today called on Congress to act on United Nations (UN) reform to hold
the body accountable for a thorough investigation of the Oil for Food
investigation.

The House International Relations Committee's newly formed Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations held a hearing this afternoon examining Paul
Volcker's interim report on the Oil for Food scandal. Congressman Flake serves
as the subcommittee's vice-chairman.

"The Volcker Report makes it clear that abuse of the Oil for Food program was
rife, and the UN's reluctance to be forthcoming is troubling," said Flake.

"The UN has had more than enough time to prove their willingness to cooperate,
yet they have chosen not to. I believe it's time for Congress to take action and
force the UN to cooperate."

Congressman Flake introduced legislation (H.R. 4284) last year that would
condition a portion of the U.S.'s funding to the UN on their cooperation in a
fair and thorough investigation of the abuses in the Oil-for-Food program.
Congressman Flake will reintroduce the bill shortly.
