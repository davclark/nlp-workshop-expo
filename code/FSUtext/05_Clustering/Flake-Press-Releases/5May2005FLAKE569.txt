Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today
highlighted another pork project contained in the massive omnibus spending bill
that Congress passed for fiscal year 2005.

This week's egregious earmark: $250,000 for a day care center in Sioux Falls,
South Dakota.

"South Dakota gets a day care center, but it's congressional appropriators that
need a 'time-out,'" said Flake.
