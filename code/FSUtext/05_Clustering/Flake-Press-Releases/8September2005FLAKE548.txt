Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents the state's Sixth District, today called
on Congress to offset spending for Hurricane Katrina relief with funding from
lower priority programs.

"If ever there was a reason to cut spending, this is it," said Flake.

"Today Congress appropriated another $50 billion in hurricane relief, and it's
just a start. That's an average contribution of more than $600 from every
household in America. Congress has the responsibility to cut spending elsewhere
if we are going to commit this amount of money."
