Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today
commented on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) moving into the Arlen Specter
Headquarters and Emergency Operations Center and opening the Thomas R. Harkin
Global Communications Center.

"Maybe I'm just envious because, with my name, it's unlikely that anybody will
ever name a building after me, but is it appropriate for sitting Members of
Congress to be naming federal buildings after themselves?" said Flake. "I think
most taxpayers would agree that it is not."

Senators Specter and Harkin are the chairman and ranking member of the
appropriations subcommittee responsible for funding the CDC. The provisions
naming the buildings after Senators Specter and Harkin were included in the
Labor-HHS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006, in violation of House rules
against naming public works after sitting Members of Congress.
