Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Congressman Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District,
today was disappointed that the conference report for the Defense Appropriation
bill for fiscal year 2008 contains over 2,000 earmarks worth five billion
dollars.

"Perhaps the most compelling case to be made against earmarking, particularly in
the Defense bill, is that earmarks divert funds away from more urgent
priorities," said Flake.

"Simply put, every dollar that Congress has spent on earmarks in this bill, five
billion dollars in all, is a dollar that troops won't have for more critical
needs."

"These earmarks don't reflect the attitude of taxpayers when it comes to defense
spending, and I wish that Congress had kept the Defense bill clean."

The Defense bill also includes 24 "airdropped" earmarks, meaning that they were
included in neither the House nor Senate versions of the bill but were added in
the conference report. Among the airdropped earmarks is $3 million for a golf
program for kids.

"This earmark might be par for the course in any other bill, but in the Defense
bill it's indefensible."
