Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. (6th CD), issued the following press release:

Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, who represents Arizona's Sixth District, today
applauded President Bush's call for line-item veto authority.

"Giving the president a line-item veto would curb wasteful spending and restrain
federal spending," said Flake. "Having said that, until the president has a
line-item veto, I'd love to see him use his current veto power to strike down an
appropriations bill and force us in Congress get our act together."
